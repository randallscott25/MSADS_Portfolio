## Description

The subject matter of this study will be derived from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) Online, which is a database of structural (phonological, grammatical, lexical) properties of languages gather from descriptive materials, from around the world. First release by Oxford University Press as a book with CD-ROM in 2005, it was released in a second addition on the internet in April 2008. The database is maintained by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. The editors are: Martin Haspelmath, Matthew S.Dryer, David Gil, and Bernard Comrie. The researcher finds it paramount to distinguish these contributors, and there works therein, before commenting further upon the study.

The purpose of this study of the above described data will be to provide insight and understanding to the dataset, the story the dataset contains and to answer further research question identified, within the document. The goal of this final project report will be to identify anything interesting within the distribution of the data, and the families of the various languages. Specifically, from the raw data can the genus familyâ€™s groupings be shown within the data, and, are there any geospatial inferences that can be made, from visual display of those findings.
