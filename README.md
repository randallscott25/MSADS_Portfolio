# MSADS_Portfolio

The Applied Data Science program at Syracuse University's School of Information Studies provides students the opportunity to collect, manage, analyze, and develop insights using data from a multitude of domains using various tools and techniques. In courses such as Database Administration, Data Analytics, Scripting For Data Analysis, and Big Data reports and presentations were developed to deliver insights using Microsoft Access, SQL Server Management Studio, Python, R, Excel, and Tableau. The skills developed at the School of Information Studies furnish data scientists focused in the field of marketing analytics with the ability to generate value within their organizations and produce actionable recommendations.

Graduates of the MS Applied Data Science program at Syracuse University School of Information Studies, in collaboration with the Whitman School of Management, must be able to demonstrate that they have been able to master each fundamental aspect of this discipline, while also being able to synthesize their individual ability to analyze, interpret and recommend actions to stakeholders in organizations when challenged with new operational problems to solve.

The intent of this Portfolio Milestone is for the student to assemble evidence and reflect on how each course they have taken has contributed to their acquisition of the cognitive strategies defined in the program learning outcomes, and how this has enabled them to become professionally prepared in their chosen area of specialty. Within the Learning Objectives section of this document, the student will use references from their course projects or assignments and reflect on how their work has demonstrated their mastery of these concepts.
