## Description
Our team was interested in finding a data set in the area of public health. We were looking for a
data set that would help us better understand a broad set of health conditions, populations,
and potential correlations. This project is an exercise in taking a large pool of data across a
variety of metrics and generating relevant questions. Through the use of tools and techniques
learned in this course, we will use those insights, which could be used to drive actions for
specific populations.
